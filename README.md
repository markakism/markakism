### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I just finished a 9 week Data Science intensive course at Le Wagon, the worldâ€™s top rated bootcamp. As one of the best experience of my life, I am determined to switch to a career in data science and data analysis. My previous experience as a civil engineer and a mobility expert, I am excited to see how data can help us shape the mobility of tomorrow.
